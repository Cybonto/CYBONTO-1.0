<h2>Centrality, Closeness</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The closeness of a node to the other nodes in a network (also called out-closeness). Loosely, Closeness is the inverse of the sum of distances in the network from a node to all other nodes.</p>

<p>The Eccentricity Centrality of a node is the normalized inverse of its maximum distance to any other node. It is highest when the distance to all other nodes is small.</p>

<h2>Centrality, Ego Betweenness</h2>

<p>The Ego (Network) Betweenness Centrality of node in a network is its betweenness score within its own ego network. The ego network contains the following: the node itself, its immediate neighbor nodes, and all links between them.</p>
<p class='measures-value-classification'>If the node of interest has a higher than normal value (greater than 1 standard deviation(s) above the mean) the row is colored <span style='color:red'>red</span>.

<h2>Centrality, Exponential Rank</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Computes the Exponential Ranking Centrality that defines the centrality of a node as its trustworthiness, which is based on the degree to which other nodes trust it. The link values define initial trust between nodes: positive values indicate trust and negative values distrust (negative link values can be used). This measure is similar to eigenvector centrality.</p>
<p class='measures-value-classification'>If the node of interest has a higher than normal value (greater than 1 standard deviation(s) above the mean) the row is colored <span style='color:red'>red</span>. The row is <span style='color:green'>green</span> if the node is within 1 standard deviation of the mean.

<h2>Centrality, In-Closeness</h2>
